# Java Internship Projects at Codsoft

This repository contains all the projects that I worked on during my Java internship at Codsoft. The projects include a Number Guessing Game, Student Grade Calculator, ATM Interface, Currency Converter, and Student Management System. 

## Project Descriptions

### Number Guessing Game
The project is a Number Guessing Game where the program generates a random number, prompts the user to guess, and provides feedback. It includes multiple rounds and score tracking.

### Student Grade Calculator
The StudentGradeCalculator Java program calculates and displays a studentâ€™s total marks, average percentage, and grade. It takes the number of subjects and their marks as input, then calculates the total and average. Grades are assigned based on the average, and the results are displayed to the user.

### ATM Interface
This project is an ATM interface that allows users to perform basic banking transactions such as depositing and withdrawing money.

### Currency Converter
This project is a currency converter that converts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

### Student Management System
This project is a student management system that allows teachers to manage their students' grades and attendance.

## Installation

To run these projects, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java from Oracle's website.
